# Very Short Client Summary

With the UniV4 + Arrakis setup, traders typically get better execution (e.g., median slippage improved by about 18% for $1k swaps), and the vault preserved value much better than simply holding (ending at 0.747 vs 0.429 on the same index).

Net: you’ll likely lose less in rough markets—and you don’t have to babysit a UniV2 position anymore.
